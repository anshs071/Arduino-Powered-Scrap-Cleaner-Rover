# Arduino Powered Scrap Cleaner Rover

## Overview
The Arduino Powered Scrap Cleaner Rover is an innovative solution for autonomous cleaning operations. It incorporates an **ultrasonic sensor** for intelligent obstacle avoidance and a **vacuum mechanism** for efficient scrap cleaning. The ultrasonic sensor ensures safe navigation by detecting obstacles, while the vacuum mechanism efficiently collects and manages encountered scrap materials. This dual-functionality, coupled with Arduino microcontrollers, exemplifies a comprehensive and precise solution for autonomous cleaning operations.

## Features
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Enables the rover to detect obstacles and navigate safely.
- **Vacuum Mechanism**: Efficiently collects and manages encountered scrap materials.
- **Arduino Microcontrollers**: Powers the rover and controls its operations.
